# CodeCred - The Live Dev Portfolio

**Your Link-in-Bio is Now a Live Dev Portfolio**. Stop just listing links. Showcase your real-time GitHub activity, latest tech articles, and project showcases with dynamic, automated content blocks. Built for developers, by developers.

## Why CodeCred?

Generic "link-in-bio" tools are built for influencers, not engineers. They fail to answer the questions that matter to clients and recruiters: "What have you built?", "How do you think?", and "What's your real expertise?".

CodeCred transforms your profile from a static list into a living dashboard of your professional identity. It pulls data directly from the sources of truth‚ÄîGitHub, your tech blog, and more‚Äîto create a dynamic, evidence-based portfolio that is always up-to-date.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Self-Hosting)

You can host your own instance of CodeCred for free. We recommend using Docker for the simplest setup.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- Docker and Docker Compose (Recommended)
- A GitHub OAuth Application for authentication.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/codecred.git
cd codecred
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and fill in the required values.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

You will need to create a GitHub OAuth App to get your `GITHUB_ID` and `GITHUB_SECRET`. The callback URL should be `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`.

### 3. Run with Docker (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get started.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Your CodeCred instance will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Run Manually (Without Docker)

If you prefer not to use Docker:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Your instance will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
